# ðŸŒ¸ Iris Flower Classification API

This is a simple machine learning deployment project using **FastAPI** and **PyTorch** to classify iris flowers into one of three species: *Setosa*, *Versicolor*, or *Virginica*.  
The model is trained on the famous **Iris dataset** using a fully connected neural network.
